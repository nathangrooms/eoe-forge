## üîß Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Error Handling
Always handle rate limits and payment errors:
```typescript
try {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('mtg-brain', { body });
  if (error) throw error;
} catch (err) {
  const errMsg = (err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err));
  if (errMsg.toLowerCase().includes('rate') || errMsg.includes('429')) {
    setError('Rate limits exceeded. Please wait before asking again.');
  } else if (errMsg.includes('payment') || errMsg.includes('402')) {
    setError('Credits required. Please add AI credits to continue.');
  }
}
```

### 2. Loading States
Provide clear feedback:
```tsx
{loading && (
  <div className="flex items-center justify-center py-8">
    <Loader2 className="h-8 w-8 animate-spin text-primary" />
    <span className="ml-3 text-muted-foreground">Analyzing...</span>
  </div>
)}
```

### 3. Conditional Rendering
Only show AI features when data is available:
```tsx
{userDecks.length > 0 && (
  <AIDeckRecommendations userDecks={userDecks} />
)}
```
